# EdenGarden
This Game is designed as a prototype by students of Isart digital Montreal.

This Game was produced by a team of 3 Game Designers (Lucien Parent-Santarelli, Basile Strang, Lucas Vauzour) and 2 programmers (Swann Rouanet and Daniel Haselock(Me)). 
We had a timeframe (as programmers) of 6 weeks.
We used Unreal engine version 5.0.3 (before the VR implementation).

EdenGarden is a VR Game based around Experimentation of building ecosystems.
The player is able to pick up statues representing various animals or plants and droping them onto the model planet. 
The statues will then transform into real creatures and roam (as real animals or trees would).


The animals are split into 2 categories: Herbivores and Carnivores.
The Herbivores are able to roam/mate/eat trees or run away from a hungry Carnivore.
The Carnivores are able to roam/mate/chase and eat Herbivores.

The trees are able to spawn other trees on the planet.

The player is able to:
  -Pick and drop statues thereby spawning creatures.
  -Rotate the planet using the 2 levers available
  -Complete missions on the scoreboards

As programmer I programmed :

   -The pathfinding.
  
   -AI interactions on the planet.
  
   -Spawning of Animals.
  
   -Implementation of Physics
  
   -Scoreboard mechanic
  
   -Rotation of the planet + use of levers
  
  

And helped contribute to:

   -Pickup and drop implementation of statues
  
   -VR implementation in Unreal (in version 5.0.3)
